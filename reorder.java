    Algorithm: 1. The problem is solved in 3 steps: find the middle element of the list, reverse the second half of the list & merge both the lists.
               2. Middle is found by hare and tortoise method
               3. Reversing of the list is done by maintaining three pointers: slow,fast and previous
               4. Two lists are merged doing pointer manipulation
